Welcome to my blog on **Artificial Intelligence in Education**.

Here I share reflections, experiments, and lessons learned from integrating AI tools into my teaching and research practice. As someone who has spent decades thinking carefully about measurement and validity, I find the emergence of large language models both exciting and worthy of critical examination.

Topics I explore include:

- **AI for Teaching**: How can LLMs like Claude, Gemini and ChatGPT enhance student learning in statistics and psychometrics?
- **AI for Research**: Using AI assistants for literature review, code development, and writing
- **Critical Perspectives**: What are the limitations and risks of AI in educational contexts?
- **Hands-On Examples**: Concrete demonstrations of AI-assisted tasks and projects
