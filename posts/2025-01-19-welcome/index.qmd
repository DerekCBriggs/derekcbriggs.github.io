## A New Chapter

After decades of teaching statistics and psychometrics, I find myself at an unexpected inflection point. The emergence of large language models---tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and others---has fundamentally changed how I think about teaching, research, and scholarly work.

This blog is my attempt to document and share what I'm learning.

## Why AI in Education?

As someone who has spent a career thinking carefully about **measurement and validity**, I approach AI with both enthusiasm and skepticism. These tools are remarkable in their capabilities, but they also raise profound questions:

- How do we know when an AI-generated response is *valid*?
- What does it mean for students to *understand* a concept if they can get an AI to solve problems for them?
- How can we use these tools to *enhance* learning rather than shortcut it?

I don't have definitive answers to these questions. But I believe that engaging with them openly---and documenting my experiments---is more valuable than avoiding the technology altogether.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I plan to share:

1. **Teaching experiments**: How I'm incorporating AI into my graduate courses on statistics and psychometrics
2. **Research workflows**: Using AI for literature review, code development, and writing
3. **Critical reflections**: Limitations, failures, and concerns
4. **Concrete examples**: Actual prompts, outputs, and lessons learned

## An Example: Building a Shiny App

Just today, I worked with Claude to build an interactive Shiny app for teaching the concept of *specific objectivity* in Rasch measurement. What would have taken me hours of coding took about 30 minutes of collaborative back-and-forth.

The app allows students to:

- Manipulate item parameters and student abilities
- See how the Rasch model maintains constant person comparisons across items
- Contrast this with the 2PL model where comparisons depend on which items are used

This is the kind of teaching tool I've wanted to create for years but never had the time. AI made it possible.

## Join the Conversation

I'm sharing this publicly because I believe we need more honest, practical accounts of how AI is changing academic work. Not hype, not fear---just careful documentation of what works, what doesn't, and what we're still figuring out.

If you're a fellow educator exploring these questions, I'd love to hear from you.
