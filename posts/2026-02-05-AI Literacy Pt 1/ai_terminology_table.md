| **Term** | **Definition** | **Key Distinction** | **Examples/Applications** |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** | Computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and pattern recognition. | Broadest category - encompasses all the terms below | Spam filters, recommendation systems, voice assistants, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems |
| **Machine Learning (ML)** | A subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data rather than following explicit programmed rules. | Distinguished by its ability to improve through experience without being explicitly programmed for every scenario | Email spam detection, credit card fraud detection, Netflix recommendations, predictive text |
| **Deep Learning** | A subset of ML using artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data. | Uses neural network architectures (inspired by the brain) rather than traditional ML algorithms like decision trees | Image recognition (facial recognition), speech recognition (Siri/Alexa), medical diagnosis from imaging |
| **Large Language Model (LLM)** | A type of deep learning model trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human language. | Specifically focused on language; uses transformer architecture; examples: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini | ChatGPT, Claude, Google Gemini, writing assistants, code generation, translation |
| **Generative AI** | AI systems that create new content (text, images, audio, video, code) rather than just analyzing or classifying existing data. | Distinguished by output - creates rather than categorizes; LLMs are one type of generative AI | ChatGPT (text), DALL-E/Midjourney (images), Suno (music), GitHub Copilot (code) |
| **Transformer** | A neural network architecture (introduced 2017) that processes sequences using attention mechanisms; foundational to modern LLMs. | Technical architecture enabling LLMs | GPT models, BERT, Claude, most modern LLMs |
