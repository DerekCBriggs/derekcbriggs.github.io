title: "How to Subscribe via RSS"

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) lets you get notified when new blog posts are published, without needing to check the website manually. Here's how to set it up:

## Step 1: Choose an RSS Reader

An RSS reader is an app that collects updates from websites you follow. Here are some free options:

| Reader | Platform | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| [Feedly](https://feedly.com) | Web, iOS, Android | Most popular, easy to use |
| [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) | Mac, iOS | Free, simple, no account needed |
| [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) | Web, iOS, Android | Full-featured free tier |

## Step 2: Add This Blog's Feed

Once you have an RSS reader:

1. **Copy this feed URL:**
   ```
   https://derekcbriggs.github.io/blog.xml
   ```

2. **In your RSS reader**, look for an option like:
   - "Add Content" or "Add Feed"
   - A **+** button
   - "Subscribe" or "Follow"

3. **Paste the feed URL** and confirm.

That's it! New posts will now appear in your RSS reader automatically.

## Why Use RSS?

- **No algorithms** - You see every post, in chronological order
- **No account needed** on my website
- **Privacy** - I don't track who subscribes
- **One place** - Follow multiple blogs in a single app
