## Biography

I am a Professor of Research and Evaluation Methodology in the School of Education at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I have been on the faculty since 2002. I currently serve as the **Associate Dean for Faculty** and as Director of the **Center for Assessment Design Research and Evaluation (CADRE)**.

My work sits at the intersection of educational measurement, psychometrics, and policy. I am driven by the fundamental question: *How do we know what students have truly learned?* This deceptively simple question leads to deep considerations of validity, reliability, and the proper interpretation of test scores.
