## What I Do

I study **educational measurement and psychometrics**---the science of what we can claim to know from test scores about what students have learned.

I direct the [Center for Assessment Design Research and Evaluation (CADRE)](https://www.colorado.edu/cadre/) and serve as **Associate Dean for Faculty** in the School of Education.

Currently, I'm exploring the intersection of **artificial intelligence and education**---both as a tool for teaching and as a subject of scholarly inquiry.
