## Welcome

I am a **Professor of Research and Evaluation Methodology** in the School of Education at the University of Colorado Boulder. I also serve as **Associate Dean for Faculty** and direct the [Center for Assessment Design Research and Evaluation (CADRE)](https://www.colorado.edu/cadre/).

My research focuses on educational measurement, psychometrics, and the validity of inferences drawn from standardized tests. I am particularly interested in questions about what we can claim to know from test scores about what students have learned.

## Current Interests

I am increasingly exploring the intersection of **artificial intelligence and education**---both as a tool for teaching and as a subject of scholarly inquiry. This website features a [blog](blog.qmd) where I share reflections on using AI in my teaching and research practice.

## Recent Highlights

- **Elected Fellow**, American Educational Research Association
- **Member**, National Academy of Education
- **Former President**, National Council on Measurement in Education
- Author of *Historical and Conceptual Foundations of Measurement in the Human Sciences*
