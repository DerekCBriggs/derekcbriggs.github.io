## Research Focus

My research addresses fundamental questions about educational measurement and assessment:

> **How do we know what students have truly learned?**

This question sits at the heart of my scholarly work and connects issues of test validity, score interpretation, psychometric modeling, and educational policy.

## Research Areas

### Validity and Assessment Arguments

I am interested in the conceptual foundations of validity---the extent to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores for their intended uses. This includes:

- The structure and logic of validity arguments
- Threats to valid score interpretation
- The relationship between reliability and validity

### Psychometric Theory and Methods

My methodological work focuses on:

- **Item Response Theory (IRT)**: Models for understanding how item characteristics relate to student ability
- **Rasch Measurement**: The concept of specific objectivity and interval-level measurement
- **Latent Variable Modeling**: Structural equation models and their applications

### Educational Accountability

I examine how test scores are used (and misused) for high-stakes decisions:

- Value-added models for teacher evaluation
- Growth models and their interpretation
- The consequences of accountability policies

### Learning Progressions

I study how student understanding develops over time:

- Defining and validating learning progressions
- Connecting curriculum, instruction, and assessment
- Developmental models of cognition

## Current Projects

I am currently exploring how AI tools can support:

- Automated item generation and review
- Analysis of student response patterns
- Teaching of statistical and psychometric concepts

Read more about these explorations on my [AI & Education Blog](blog.qmd).
